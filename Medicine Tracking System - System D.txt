Medicine Tracking System - System Design Document
1. Implementation Approach
We will implement a comprehensive personal medicine tracking system using modern web technologies with localStorage for data persistence. The system will be built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) to ensure offline functionality and mobile responsiveness.

Key Implementation Tasks:
Frontend Architecture - Build a responsive single-page application using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript with modular component architecture
Data Management Layer - Implement robust localStorage-based data persistence with validation, backup, and recovery mechanisms
Medicine Management - Create comprehensive medicine catalog with detailed information, stock tracking, and expiry management
Administration Logging - Develop precise tablet-level tracking with timestamp logging and adherence monitoring
Glucose Tracking - Implement glucose level recording with trend analysis and reporting capabilities
Notification System - Build browser-based notification system for medication reminders and low stock alerts
Reporting & Analytics - Create comprehensive reporting dashboard with adherence metrics and export functionality
Data Security - Implement client-side data encryption and validation for sensitive health information
2. Main User-UI Interaction Patterns
Primary User Workflows:
Daily Medicine Taking

User opens dashboard and sees today’s scheduled medications
Clicks “Take Medicine” button for specific medication
System logs timestamp, updates stock count, and shows confirmation
User can add notes about side effects or effectiveness
Medicine Stock Management

User adds new medicine with complete details (name, strength, dosage form, instructions)
System tracks individual tablets and maintains current stock levels
User receives alerts when stock falls below minimum threshold
User logs refills with batch numbers and expiry dates
Glucose Level Monitoring

User quickly logs glucose readings with measurement context (fasting, post-meal)
System categorizes readings and provides immediate feedback on normal ranges
User can view trends and patterns over time with visual charts
Adherence Monitoring

System automatically calculates adherence rates based on scheduled vs. actual doses
User can view detailed adherence reports with missed doses and timing analysis
Export functionality allows sharing data with healthcare providers
3. System Architecture
The system follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

Stock Update - Stock service decrements tablet count and creates stock record
Log Creation - Administration service creates detailed log entry with timestamp
Adherence Calculation - System calculates adherence metrics and updates statistics
Notification Check - System checks for low stock conditions and triggers alerts
UI Update - Dashboard refreshes to show updated stock levels and recent activity
Data Persistence Flow:
Data Validation - All input data undergoes comprehensive validation
Encryption - Sensitive data is encrypted before storage

Backup Creation - Automatic backup creation for data recovery
Integrity Check - Data integrity validation after storage operations
6. LocalStorage Schema Design
Storage Structure:
// Medicine definitions and current stock
localStorage['med_tracker_medicines'] = {
  "med_001": {
    id: "med_001",
    name: "Aspirin",
    genericName: "Acetylsalicylic Acid",
    strength: "81mg",
    dosageForm: "Tablet",
    currentStock: 30,
    minStockLevel: 10,
    // ... additional fields
  }
}

// Stock transaction history
localStorage['med_tracker_stock_records'] = {
  "stock_001": {
    id: "stock_001",
    medicineId: "med_001",
    operation: "administration",
    quantityChanged: -1,
    previousStock: 31,
    newStock: 30,
    timestamp: "2024-01-15T08:05:00Z"
    // ... additional fields
  }
}

// Administration logs
localStorage['med_tracker_administration_logs'] = {
  "admin_001": {
    id: "admin_001",
    medicineId: "med_001",
    dosageTaken: 1,
    scheduledTime: "2024-01-15T08:00:00Z",
    actualTime: "2024-01-15T08:05:00Z",
    adherenceStatus: "on_time",
    tabletsRemaining: 30
    // ... additional fields
  }
}

// Glucose readings
localStorage['med_tracker_glucose_readings'] = {
  "glucose_001": {
    id: "glucose_001",
    value: 120,
    unit: "mg/dL",
    measurementType: "fasting",
    timestamp: "2024-01-15T07:30:00Z",
    beforeAfterMeal: "before"
    // ... additional fields
  }
}

// User settings and preferences
localStorage['med_tracker_user_settings'] = {
  notifications: {
    enabled: true,
    reminderTimes: ["08:00", "12:00", "18:00"],
    lowStockAlert: true
  },
  display: {
    theme: "light",
    language: "en",
    dateFormat: "MM/DD/YYYY"
  },
  backup: {
    autoBackup: true,
    backupFrequency: "daily",
    lastBackup: "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
7. UI Navigation Flow
The application follows a hub-and-spoke navigation pattern with the Dashboard as the central hub:

Dashboard serves as the main entry point with quick access to all major functions
Maximum navigation depth of 3 levels to ensure user doesn’t get lost
Consistent back navigation available at every level
Breadcrumb navigation for complex workflows
Quick action buttons for high-frequency tasks (Take Medicine, Log Glucose)
Navigation priorities:

High-frequency actions (taking medicine, logging glucose) are prominently featured
Critical information (low stock alerts, missed doses) is surfaced immediately
Administrative functions (adding medicines, settings) are easily accessible but not prominent
Reporting functions are grouped together with clear export options
8. Technology Stack
Frontend Technologies:
HTML5 with semantic markup for accessibility
CSS3 with Flexbox/Grid for responsive layouts
Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) with modular architecture
Web APIs: Notification API, File System Access API, Service Worker API
Progressive Web App features for offline functionality
Data Management:
localStorage for primary data persistence
IndexedDB as fallback for large datasets
JSON for data serialization
Client-side encryption for sensitive data protection
Development Tools:
Webpack for module bundling and optimization
Babel for JavaScript transpilation
ESLint for code quality
Prettier for code formatting
Jest for unit testing
9. Security and Privacy Considerations
Data Protection:
Client-side encryption for all sensitive health data
Data validation to prevent injection attacks
Input sanitization for all user inputs
No external data transmission - all data remains on user’s device
Privacy Features:
Local-only storage - no cloud synchronization by default
User-controlled exports for data sharing with healthcare providers
Data anonymization options for analytics
Secure deletion capabilities for sensitive information
10. Performance Optimization
Storage Optimization:
Data compression for large datasets
Lazy loading of historical data
Efficient indexing for fast searches
Automatic cleanup of old records based on user preferences
UI Performance:
Virtual scrolling for large lists
Debounced search for real-time filtering
Optimistic UI updates for better user experience
Service worker caching for offline functionality
11. Unclear Aspects and Assumptions
Assumptions Made:
Single User System - Designed for individual use, not multi-user households
Browser Compatibility - Targeting modern browsers with localStorage support
Data Retention - Assuming users want to keep historical data indefinitely unless manually deleted
Medication Scheduling - Assuming users will manually track scheduled times rather than complex recurring schedules
Glucose Units - Defaulting to mg/dL but supporting mmol/L conversion
Areas Requiring Clarification:
Data Export Format - Should we support specific healthcare data standards (HL7, FHIR)?
Medication Database - Should we include a pre-populated medicine database or rely entirely on user input?
Reminder Complexity - Do we need support for complex dosing schedules (every other day, tapering doses)?
Multi-device Sync - Is there a future requirement for synchronizing data across devices?
Healthcare Integration - Should we plan for future integration with healthcare provider systems?
Technical Uncertainties:
Storage Limits - localStorage has browser-specific size limits that may affect long-term users
Data Migration - Strategy for handling schema changes in future versions
Backup Reliability - Ensuring data backup integrity without server-side validation
Performance Scaling - How the system will perform with years of accumulated data
